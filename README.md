We plan on sharing content through the medium of a game. Similarly to the games made on ARIS that allowed the user to experience learning and gameplay by way of augmented reality, our game experience will attempt to place the user in a text based, informative Ancient Egyptian environment. We think this model suits our process because of it's level of engagement, while still portraying relevant information in a fun and interactive way.

Currently we are considering using the Python library "pygame" to build our game. Pygame allows for simple manipulation of 2d pixel space and appears to be able to create simple decision based gameplay without too much trouble, which makes it a good candidate for our project. (It also allows us to keep track of items and assets, where some more linear story based game creators may fall short on)

Our next steps will be framing and structuring our game. We will have to consider what 3D models we will be including and their significance. We will begin brainstorming characters, and challenges that the player will face. We will have to do some more research on the Egyptian afterlife to ensure we are conveying accurate information. Then we will begin structuring our game in pygame.
